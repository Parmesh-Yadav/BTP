      "The meaning of life is a deep philosophical question that has been pondered by humans for centuries. There is no one definitive answer to this question, as it is a matter of personal interpretation and belief. Some people believe that the meaning of life is to find happiness and fulfillment, while others believe that it is to make a positive impact on the world. Still others believe that life has no inherent meaning, and that it is up to each individual to create their own meaning.

Petitioners paid their assessments in full, while their neighbors-owners of approximately 150 other parcels-elected to pay in monthly installments over 10, 20, or 30 years.

The City forgave the outstanding balances of those taxpayers who were paying in installments, but it refused to refund payments made by those who had already paid in full. The Indiana Supreme Court-in conflict with decisions of a federal court holding the very same conduct unconstitutional and other state high courts-held that this action did not violate the Equal Protection Clause, even though it allowed the City to retain from each petitioner 30 times as much in assessed taxes as identically situated owners paid.

Should this Court issue a GVR order in this case, directing the Ninth Circuit to reconsider its decision that the unconstitutional exclusion of reliable evidence of third party guilt can be harmless, in light of Holmes and House?\\nIf constitutional error in a state trial is not recognized by the judiciary until the case ends up in federal court under 28 U.S.C. § 2254, is the prejudicial impact of the error assessed under the standard set forth in Chapman v. California, 386 U.S. 18 (1967), or that enunciated in Brecht v. Abrahamson, 507 U.S. 619 (1993)? Does it matter which harmless error standard is employed?

       "'Petitioners are the owners of 31 residential real estate parcels in Indianapolis, Indiana, who were assessed approximately $9,000 each for connection to a public sewer system. Petitioners paid their assessments in full, while their neighbors-owners of approximately 150 other parcels-elected to pay in monthly installments over 10, 20, or 30 years. Shortly thereafter, the City adopted a new assessment scheme that vastly reduced each taxpayer\\'s burden. The City forgave the outstanding balances of those taxpayers who were paying in installments, but it refused to refund payments made by those who had already paid in full. The Indiana Supreme Court-in conflict with decisions of a federal court holding the very same conduct unconstitutional and other state high courts-held that this action did not violate the Equal Protection Clause, even though it allowed the City to retain from each petitioner 30 times as much in assessed taxes as identically situated owners paid. In so holding, the 3-2 majority of the Indiana Supreme Court dismissed this Court\\'s unanimous decision in Allegheny Pittsburgh Coal Co. v. County Commission, 488 U.S. 336 (1989), as \"narrowed to its facts.\" App. 28a.\\nWhether the Equal Protection Clause precludes a local taxing authority from refusing to refund payments made by those who have paid their assessments in full, while forgiving the obligations of identically situated taxpayers who chose to pay over a multi-year installment plan.'"

      "    Question: Petitioners are the owners of 31 residential real estate parcels in Indianapolis, Indiana, who were assessed approximately $9,000 each for connection to a public sewer system. Petitioners paid their assessments in full, while their neighbors-owners of approximately 150 other parcels-elected to pay in monthly installments over 10, 20, or 30 years. Shortly thereafter, the City adopted a new assessment scheme that vastly reduced each taxpayer's burden. The City forgave the outstanding balances of those taxpayers who were paying in installments, but it refused to refund payments made by those who had already paid in full. The Indiana Supreme Court-in conflict with decisions of a federal court holding the very same conduct unconstitutional and other state high courts-held that this action did not violate the Equal Protection Clause, even though it allowed the City to retain from each petitioner 30 times as much in assessed taxes as identically situated owners paid. In so holding, the 3-2 majority of the Indiana Supreme Court dismissed this Court's unanimous decision in Allegheny Pittsburgh Coal Co. v. County Commission, 488 U.S. 336 (1989), as \"narrowed to its facts.\" App. 28a.\n",

      "    Choice3: holding that concerns about administrative expense provided a rational basis for classification\n",

However, the Secretary of the Treasury, acting through the ATF, may grant relief from that prohibition if certain preconditions are established (Felony). Since 1992, however, every appropriations law for ATF has specified that ATF may not expend any appropriated funds to act upon applications for such relief (Prohibition).

This holding is most relevant because it directly addresses the question of whether a federal district court has authority to grant relief from firearms disabilities to persons convicted of a felony, despite an appropriations provision barring the ATF from acting on such applications.
