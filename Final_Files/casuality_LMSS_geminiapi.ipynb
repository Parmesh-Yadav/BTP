      "The meaning of life is a deeply personal and philosophical question that has been pondered by humans for centuries. There is no one definitive answer, as the meaning of life can vary depending on individual beliefs, values, and experiences. However, some common themes that have emerged in discussions about the meaning of life include:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Finding purpose and fulfillment in one's own life.** This could involve setting goals, pursuing passions, and making a positive impact on the world.\n",
      "* **Connecting with others and building relationships.** Social connections are essential for human well-being and can provide a sense of belonging and meaning.\n",
      "* **Learning and growing throughout one's life.** Continuous learning and personal development can help individuals find purpose and fulfillment, and can also make them more resilient to life's challenges.\n",
      "* **Contributing to something larger than oneself.** This could involve volunteering for a cause one cares about, or simply being a kind and compassionate person.\n",
      "* **Finding meaning in the present moment.** Mindfulness practices can help individuals focus on the present moment and find joy and gratitude in the small things in life.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ultimately, the meaning of life is something that each individual must discover for themselves. There is no right or wrong answer, and the meaning of life can change over time as individuals grow and change. By reflecting on their own values and experiences, individuals can find their own unique meaning in life and live a fulfilling and purposeful existence.\n"

       "['This review indicates that the statements in Sheehan and People Who Care that an expert\\'s failure to consider variables other than the salient characteristic renders his opinions inadmissible are outliers. HN26 There are some common themes in the cases: statistics play an important role in a plaintiffs\\' ability to make a prima facie case of pattern-or-practice discrimination; experts should carefully formulate their initial hypotheses; experts should consider variables other than the salient characteristic and their failure to do so weakens and renders less probative their conclusions. But particularly when plaintiffs have other evidence (such as individual testimony about personal experiences of discrimination), the weight of decision seems to treat failure to consider other variables as a factor going to the weight of the statistical evidence and not as a factor that renders the evidence inadmissible. The court concludes that Neumark\\'s failure to follow what the Seventh Circuit appears to deem \"best practices\" by failing to consider variables other than the salient factor of race does not render his opinions so unreliable that the statistical evidence is irrelevant [*132]  on that basis alone. The court concludes that if the only flaw in Neumark\\'s methodology had been his failure to account for variables other than race, the evidence would have been relevant to the plaintiffs\\' allegations that Infosys discriminated under Rule 401\\'s \"liberal,\" basic standard of relevance, Daubert, 509 U.S. at 587, and the defendants\\' criticisms would go to the probative value, or weight, that the trier of fact should give that evidence.16\\n',\n",
       " 'A statistical study is not inadmissible merely because it is unable to exclude all possible causal factors other than the one of interest. But a statistical study that fails to correct for salient explanatory variables, or even to make the most elementary comparisons, has no value as causal explanation and  [*538]  is therefore inadmissible in a federal court. The idea that the educational deficiencies of minority students in the Rockford public schools are due primarily to discrimination by the school authorities and can be rectified by an equitable decree is at once unsubstantiated by responsible evidence and--since there is no evidence that these deficiencies are any greater than in school districts around the country that have not been held to have discriminated against minority students-- implausible.\\n\\nTracking might be adopted in order to segregate the races. The well-known correlation between race and academic performance makes tracking, even when implemented in accordance with strictly objective criteria, a pretty effective segregator. If tracking were adopted for this purpose, then enjoining tracking would be a proper as well as the natural remedy for this form of intentional discrimination, at least if there were no compelling evidence that it improves the academic performance of minority children and if the possible benefits to the better students and the social interest [**28]  in retaining them in the public schools were given little weight. The general view is that tracking does not benefit minority students, Daniel U. Levine & Rayna F. Levine, Society and Education 38-41 (9th ed. 1996), although there is evidence that some of them do benefit. Adam Gamoran & Robert D. Mare, \"Secondary School Tracking and Educational Inequality: Compensation, Reinforcement, or Neutrality?\" 94 Am. J. Sociology 1146, 1177 (1989). All this is neither here nor there. The plaintiffs\\' argument is not that the school district adopted tracking way back when in order to segregate the schools. It is that it misused tracking, twisting the criteria to achieve greater segregation than objective tracking alone would have done. See 851 F. Supp. at 913-14. The school district should be enjoined from doing this--not, on this record, enjoined from tracking.',\n",
       " \"Equally without evidentiary significance is the statistical analysis of the list of 17; indeed, the analysis was not even admissible under HN4 the standard of Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 509 U.S. 579, 125 L. Ed. 2d 469, 113 S. Ct. 2786 (1993), governing the admissibility of expert testimony, which requires the district judge to satisfy himself that the expert is being as careful as he would be in his regular professional work outside his paid litigation consulting. E.g., Braun v. Lorillard Inc., 84 F.3d 230, 234-35 (7th Cir. 1996); Rosen v. Ciba-Geigy Corp., 78 F.3d 316, 318 (7th Cir. 1996); Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 43 F.3d 1311, 1316-19 (9th Cir. 1995); cf. Mid-State Fertilizer Co. v.  [**7]  Exchange National Bank, 877 F.2d 1333, 1339 (7th Cir. 1989). Although the expert used standard statistical methods for determining whether there was a significant correlation between age and retention for the 17 persons on the list, see Michael O. Finkelstein & Bruce Levin, Statistics for Lawyers 157 (1990) (Fisher's exact test), the omission of Sebring and Shulman from the sample tested was arbitrary. The expert should at least have indicated the sensitivity of his analysis to these omissions. More important is the expert's failure to correct for any potential explanatory variables other than age. Completely ignored was the more than remote possibility that age was correlated with a legitimate job-related qualification, such as familiarity with computers. Everyone knows that younger people are on average more comfortable with computers than older people are, just as older people are on average more comfortable with manual-shift cars than younger people are. Three weeks of training might go some distance toward closing the computer-literacy gap, yet it would be more surprising than otherwise if so short a period of training could close the gap completely. The expert could easily [**8]  have inquired about the feasibility of ascertaining through discovery the history of the use of computers by each of the employees on the list of 17.\",\n",
       " 'The expert\\'s failure to make any adjustment for variables bearing on the decision whether to discharge or retain a person on the list other than age--his equating a simple statistical correlation to a causal relation (\"of course, if age had no role in termination, we should expect that equal proportions of older and younger employees would be terminated\"--true only if no other factor relevant to termination is correlated with age)--indicates a failure to exercise the degree of care that a statistician would use in his scientific work, outside of the context of litigation. In litigation an expert may consider (he may have a financial [**9]  incentive to consider) looser standards to apply. Since the expert\\'s statistical study would not have been admissible at trial, it was entitled to zero weight in considering whether to grant or deny summary judgment.',\n",
       " 'Dr. Vekker analyzes only correlation and is up front about that goal: \"Dr. Bloom\\'s analysis fundamentally ignores the relevant question that I am answering . . . the question in this case whether there are gender disparities in compensation and selections for promotions in Tax and Advisory functions at KPMG.\" Dr. Vekker\\'s regressions convincingly answer this threshold question of correlation in the affirmative, which is an important starting point. Defendant is correct that, for the reasons discussed below, Dr. Vekker\\'s report, coupled with the remainder of Plaintiffs\\' evidence, does not convincingly show that causation can be determined on a classwide basis -- but this does not mean that Dr. Vekker\\'s testimony is unhelpful. Dr. Vekker\\'s testimony need only logically advance Plaintiffs\\' case. It does so by showing that disparities exist and affect all members of the Proposed Class. The motion is denied.\\n',\n",
       " 'Mariner\\'s [**21]  explanation is not so convincing as to render Integra\\'s explanation implausible at the pleading stage. Integra sought to control for, inter alia, the \"access to care available to the [SNF] patients\" sampled in its models through the use of county-level demographic variables (e.g., unemployment rate, percent of population without a high school diploma, log median income). See FAC ¶ 95 (Equation 1, Panels A and B). But even if Integra did not explicitly factor a more difficult locus of discharge into its regression model, the likelihood that locus of discharge would be the cause of the higher rate of UHR across all 58 principal diagnosis codes (with a sample size of over 13 million SNF admissions) is not so obvious as to render Integra\\'s explanation implausible. Starr, 652 F.3d at 1216. Mariner has not pointed to any evidence that there are such significant differences in locus of discharge at Mariner and non-Mariner facilities. If such differences existed, one would expect that they would appear in the data and influence the UHR rates with respect to certain diagnosis codes, but Mariner has pointed to no such pattern. Cf. Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 679, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 1950, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009) (in assessing plausibility, the Court should \"draw on its judicial experience and common [**22]  sense\").',\n",
       " \"Here, the scope and specificity of the plaintiffs' investigation and the alleged precision with which its proffered regression analysis can attribute the plaintiffs' injuries to the defendants' actions, provide plausible proximate cause.13 The statistical evidence offered, like the differential impact of the mobile home park's documentation policy in Reyes and the costs incurred by the tax base in City of Miami, is precisely the kind of statistical evidence of disparate effects that is cognizable under the FHA. The statistics and regression analyses presented in the complaint raise a fair inference of causation. While the defendants' critique of the investigation's composite variables also may have some merit, see NFHA v. U.S. Bank, N.A., No. 01-12-0283-8 (HUD Jan. 8, 2016), Bank of America Mot. Dismiss, Ex. 1, ECF No. 44-3, they do not defeat the well-pled factual contention that the defendants' delegation of its maintenance responsibilities—in the aggregate—caused disparate racial impact. The other factors considered in the City of Miami proximate [**39]  cause calculus do not change this result. While the risk of additional plaintiffs and multiple recoveries may be marginally greater than that in City of Miami where the city was the only injured party, the risk is mitigated by the necessary investigative depth and statistical sophistication required to bring a disparate impact claim. See City of Miami, 923 F.3d 1286-87. By the same token, it is hard to imagine a plaintiff better situated to bring these claims than a group of the nation's, preeminent nonprofit fair housing organizations. See id. at 1288-89. In sum, the complaint surmounts the causality hurdle imposed by Inclusive Communities, but the extent of the investigation's  [*638]  accuracy, and the plaintiffs' statistical methodology, will be subjected to rigorous factual analysis at the summary judgment stage.\",\n",
       " 'To explore a possible cause and effect relationship further study is required. The investigator should then observe the effect on one variable, the dependent variable, of manipulation of another, an independent variable. Id. at 348. Independent variables represent the possible \"causes\" of the \"effect\" being studied. If the study does not contemplate the results of manipulating various independent variables, it does little to prove causation. That is because the real cause of the observed results may be variables other than the one with which the dependent variable is associated. When an association is identified among variables, a controlled experiment will help identify which independent variable caused the effect. In fact, this is the best way to eliminate other variables as possible causes of observed associations. Id. at 347. If a controlled experiment [**31]  is not conducted, then the investigator should at least measure the group in which the effect occurred against a comparable group in which the effect is not expected or observed. See id. at 349. The key to success, however, is that the second group actually be comparable.\\n\\nThe statistics offered by the plaintiffs have only eliminated random chance as a possible explanation for the disparities. See Pls.\\' Ex. 56, Wertheimer Report at 8, PP 14, 16, 20-22, 28; Defs.\\' App. 108, Rothman Report at 4; see also EEOC v. Sears Roebuck & Co. 839 F.2d 302, 323 n.20 (7th Cir. 1988) (standard deviation and other measures of statistical [**43]  significance merely attempt to eliminate chance as reason for results, do not prove causation). That method would be valid if it is reasonable to assume that the job skills the defendants needed to retain were equally distributed across age groups. See Barnes, 896 F.2d at 1466. If it is not reasonable so to assume, a defendant can show that the statistical method is faulty, or that chance does explain the discrepancy, and the statistical evidence may lose its effectiveness altogether. Id. at 1469. If it is reasonable, the statistical evidence that shows a greater number of terminations among certain age groups than would be expected due to chance, may state a prima facie case for age discrimination. Id.\\n\\n',\n",
       " 'In the Sixth Circuit, it is required that in order to indicate pretext \"the statistics must show a significant disparity and eliminate the most common nondiscriminatory explanations for the disparity.\" Barnes v. Gencorp, 896 F.2d 1457, 1466 (6th Cir. 1990)(citation omitted). Here, the Thompson \"analysis\" does nothing more than, first, to note that no female truck drivers had been hired and then to calculate the likelihood of that happening by chance,  [*22]  assuming that 6.9% female drivers should have been on the Commission\\'s truck-driving roster.\\nIf taken merely at face value and viewed in the very best light, the importance of this statistical observation would be only to demonstrate a \"significant statistical] disparity.\" Simply stated, it begins with the assumption that there should have been a certain female constituency, and ends with the statement that, because none was observed, there was a female constituency \"shortfall.\" The Report does not in any realistic way \"analyze\" anything, nor does it proceed to \"eliminate . . . common nondiscriminatory explanations\" as required under Barnes.\\n\\nOf most fundamental concern to the court is that the Thompson/Paranjpe report is based solely on the premise that there is a state-mandated \"requirement\" of no fewer than 6.9% females in the Commission\\'s workforce.',\n",
       " 'One nondiscriminatory reason advanced by defendant is that the workers terminated during the WRP were not performing as well as the workers who were retained. Plaintiff\\'s statistics are \"not . . . probative because they do not include the qualifications of both the individuals retained and the individuals terminated.\" Swanson v. Leggett & Platt, Inc., 154 F.3d 730, 734 (7th Cir. 1998) (holding that data showing that seven of 15 senior managers over 40 lost their jobs in year while only one senior manager under 40 was terminated was not probative of pretext) (citing Vanasco v. National-Louis Univ., 137 F.3d 962, 967 (7th Cir. 1998); [*41]  Fisher v. Wayne Dalton Corp., 139 F.3d 1137, 1140-41 (7th Cir. 1998)). 14\\n\\nPlaintiff\\'s statistics therefore do not eliminate or refute defendant\\'s nondiscriminatory explanation. Plaintiff has not presented any evidence that the under-forty entry level managers who were retained [*42]  did not receive higher performance evaluations than the over-forty entry level managers who were let go. See, e.g., Fallis v. Kerr-McGee Corp., 944 F.2d 743, 746-47 (10th Cir. 1991) (using this analysis in a RIF case and concluding that the plaintiff\\'s statistical evidence did not demonstrate that the defendant\\'s proffered reason was pretextual). \"HN16 Because there is a nondiscriminatory explanation for the disparate treatment between the [entry level managers] under forty and the [entry level managers] over forty by [defendant], the statistics relied on by plaintiff do not permit an inference of age discrimination.\" Id. at 747.',\n",
       " 'Moreover, Farber\\'s finding that the residuals represent gender-based differences is also founded. The use of statistics in sex discrimination cases is common. See United States v. City of New York (City of New York II), 731 F. Supp. 2d 291, 300 (E.D.N.Y. 2010) (disparate impact); City of New York III, 717 F.3d at 85 (disparate treatment). Indeed, the Second Circuit has stated that \"[i]t is apodictic that \\'statistical reports may . . . be admissible to support an inference of discrimination.\\'\" Bickerstaff v. Vassar College, 196 F.3d 435, 448 (2d Cir. 1999) (quoting Raskin v. Wyatt Co., 125 F.3d 55, 67 (2d Cir. 1997)). Regression modeling, the form of statistical analysis Farber used, attempts to eliminate other possible causes, leaving only the studied variable as the cause of the difference observed, also called the residual. Ottaviani, 875 F.2d 365 at 367. In employment discrimination cases, statistical significance at the 5% level, or approximately two standard deviations, is sufficient to make a prima facie case. Smith v. Xerox Corp., 196 F.3d 358, 366 (2d Cir. 1999), overruled [*28]  on other grounds by Meacham v. Knolls Atomic Power Lab., 461 F.3d 134 (2d Cir. 2006). Such a statistical significance means that there is a 5% probability that the difference found is due to chance rather than being caused by the studied process. Id. Here, Farber\\'s regression analyses show statistical significance at the 5% level, so his studies indicates that there is a 5% chance that the residuals (i.e. the difference in treatment) result from something other than differences in the employee\\'s gender. Farber Report ¶¶ 76, 79, 81-83, 98-102, 104-105, 134-135. The Court, therefore, finds that Farber can testify that the differences he found were based on gender.\\n',\n",
       " 'Barak-Corren admits she can\\'t explain why her survey suggests many more vendors would\\'ve been willing to serve same-sex couples than opposite-sex couples before Masterpiece, and what that means for the level of \"discrimination\" she infers before and after the Supreme Court\\'s decision. See Expert Report at 22 n.28. Were opposite-sex couples experiencing more discrimination than same-sex couples in the wedding marketplace before 2018? Surely not. The City takes the opposite position. City Daubert Response at 13. Yet the study suggests as much. At least some of that disparity can be chalked up to its treatment of pre-Masterpiece non-responses as neutral but post-Masterpiece non-responses as discriminatory rejection. Post-Masterpiece, more vendors (75.5%) responded to opposite-sex requests than to inquiries from the fictitious same-sex couples (63.3%). So the study cannot reliably indicate whether, and how severely, Masterpiece changed vendors\\' willingness to serve same-sex couples.13',\n",

Excluding Sue Bell Cobb from this measure, that number increases to 2.1 percentage points. Id. And, since those results hold constant the percentage of registered voters who are African American, Trial Tr. V, at 66 (Bonneau), it is unlikely that a [**126]  \"lag\" in white support for black Democrats is being disguised by a \"boost\" in black support for black Democrats. In fact, Dr. Bonneau found that, in areas with the highest percentage of African-American voters, black Democrats either perform worse than white Democrats or there are no statistically significant differences. Bonneau Expert Report, at 16, ¶ 38 (Defs.\\' Trial Ex. 24; Doc. # 85-1).

Dr. Mayer relied upon the data set provided by Mr. Ely—which combined surname and ACS data—to analyze endogenous and exogenous elections. Rather than employing an ecological regression analysis to estimate individual voting behavior from this data, Dr. Mayer relied on an ecological inference analysis.

Specifically, the Complaint alleges that the County often treated her past requests for leave due to her disability with antagonism and expressed this antagonism with a notation \"w/no choice!\" on a form approving a request for FMLA leave.19 Compl. ¶ 9; id., Ex. C. Moreover, Dreibelbis alleges she was terminated eight days after she requested and took—albeit without approval—leave owing to her disability. See id. ¶¶ 9-12. These allegations are, in the Court\\'s view, sufficient to form a reasonable expectation that discovery may reveal further evidence to support Dreibelbis\\' contention that the County\\'s decision to terminate her employment was motivated by her disability.',\n",

Kelley\\'s conclusory allegation of disparate [**43]  treatment is insufficient to permit an inference of discrimination. See Hager, 735 F.3d at 1015 (holding that to support an inference of discrimination based on disparate treatment, plaintiffs must allege that \"similarly situated employees\" were treated more favorably (citing Coleman v. Md. Ct. App., 626 F.3d 187, 190-91 (4th Cir. 2010))). Kelley\\'s complaint vaguely refers to \"male and white colleagues in ISU\\'s Administration\" without alleging any facts suggesting those colleagues were similarly situated. Compl. ¶ 151. Kelley alleges she served as Title IX coordinator, equal opportunity director, affirmative action compliance officer, Section 504 coordinator, ADA compliance officer, and civil rights investigator. The nonspecific term \"colleagues\" encompasses a broad spectrum of administrative personnel at ISU, but fails to identify any who were similarly situated—particularly in light of the constellation of roles that Kelly held at ISU. Thus, Kelley\\'s allegation that she was treated disparately from white and male colleagues does not give rise to a circumstantial inference of discrimination. Because Kelley has not plausibly alleged facts supporting the fourth element of a prima facie claim of unlawful race and gender discrimination under Title VII, Count III must be dismissed.

Nor is there evidence of white Atrium employees engaging in comparably serious misconduct without experiencing similarly harsh employment consequences. As such, Carter has not shown that similarly situated employees outside of his protected class were treated more favorably than him after engaging in similar misconduct.

The second had an undergraduate degree in event management. And the third served as a Night Auditor at another hotel for five years, which both parties acknowledge represents management experience.

In addition, the record shows that Atrium has hired Black men for the Assistant Front Office Manager position in the past.
