"Petitioners are the owners of 31 residential real estate parcels in Indianapolis, Indiana, who were assessed approximately $9,000 each for connection to a public sewer system. Petitioners paid their assessments in full, while their neighbors-owners of approximately 150 other parcels-elected to pay in monthly installments over 10, 20, or 30 years. Shortly thereafter, the City adopted a new assessment scheme that vastly reduced each taxpayer's burden. The City forgave the outstanding balances of those taxpayers who were paying in installments, but it refused to refund payments made by those who had already paid in full. The Indiana Supreme Court-in conflict with decisions of a federal court holding the very same conduct unconstitutional and other state high courts-held that this action did not violate the Equal Protection Clause, even though it allowed the City to retain from each petitioner 30 times as much in assessed taxes as identically situated owners paid. In so holding, the 3-2 majority of the Indiana Supreme Court dismissed this Court's unanimous decision in Allegheny Pittsburgh Coal Co. v. County Commission, 488 U.S. 336 (1989), as ""narrowed to its facts."" App. 28a.
Whether the Equal Protection Clause precludes a local taxing authority from refusing to refund payments made by those who have paid their assessments in full, while forgiving the obligations of identically situated taxpayers who chose to pay over a multi-year installment plan.",3,3
"The courts of appeals are divided about the jurisdiction of district courts to entertain Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b) motions in habeas corpus cases. Seven circuits address the continuing viability of Rule 60(b) on a flexible case-by-case basis, while three circuits, including the Eleventh Circuit below, hold that AEDP A erects a bright line jurisdictional bar to Rule 60(b) motions in habeas corpus proceedings. The conflict among the circuits has exacerbated since the Court dismissed as improvidently granted Abdur'Rahman v. Bell, 537 U.S. 88 (2002). The instant petition replicates for the Court's consideration the questions left unanswered in Abdur'Rahman, without the procedural and jurisdictional difficulties that caused it to be dismissed:
Whether the court of appeals erred in holding that every Rule 60(b) motion (other than for fraud under (b)(3)) constitutes a prohibited ""second or successive"" petition as a matter of law, in square conflict with decisions of this Court and of other circuits.",3,2
"Whether the Beef Promotion and Research Act of 1985 (Beef Act), 7 U.S.C. 2901 et seq., and the implementing Beef Promotion and Research Order (Beef Order), 7 C.F.R.

"Employee benefit plans often cover a participant's medical bills in the event of injury but require that, if the participant obtains compensation from a third party for that injury, he or she reimburse the plan in full. Under Section 502(a)(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (""ERISA""), plans may enforce these reimbursement provisions in court by seeking ""appropriate equitable relief” to enforce ""the terms of the plan."" 29 U.S.C. § 1132(a)(3). Twice in recent years this Court has resolved disputes about how Section 502(a)(3) works in reimbursement actions. In the more recent case, Sereboff v. Mid Atlantic Medical Services, Inc., 547 U.S. 356 (2006), the Court expressly reserved a third question about the provision. The Third Circuit, in its words, has now ""squarely"" answered ""the question that Sereboff left open,"" Pet. App. 9a, and has done so in a way that, as it acknowledged, splits the circuits.
Whether the Third Circuit correctly held-in conflict with the Fifth, Seventh, Eighth, Eleventh, and D.C. Circuits-that ERISA Section 502(a)(3) authorizes courts to use equitable principles to rewrite contractual language and refuse to order participants to reimburse their plan for benefits paid, even where the plan's terms give it an absolute right to full reimbursement.",1,1
"Under  federal  law,  a  person  who  is  convicted  of  a  felony  is  prohibited  from possessing  firearms.  The  Secretary  of  the  Treasury,  acting  through  the  Bureau  of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF), may grant relief from that prohibition if it is established  to  his  satisfaction  that  certain  preconditions  are  established.    See  18 U.S.C. 925(c). Since 1992, however, every appropriations law for ATF has specified that ATF may not expend any appropriated funds to act upon applications for such relief.
The question presented is whether, despite that appropriations provision barring ATF from acting on such applications, a federal district court has authority to grant relief from firearms disabilities to persons convicted of a felony.",2,2
"In Lindh v. Murphy, 521 U.S. 320 (1997), this Court held that the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA) (28 U.S.C. § 2241, etseq.) did not apply to cases which commenced prior to the AEDPA ' s April 24, 1996, effective date. The circuits are split as to when a capital case commences for purposes of triggering the AEDPA. With one exception, all the circuits to consider the issue have found the AEDPA applies if the actual petition was filed on or after the AEDPA's effective date. However, in the Ninth Circuit, the AEDPA does not apply to a federal petition filed on or after April 24, 1996, if motions for appointment of counsel and stay of execution were filed before that date.

"The courts of appeals are deeply divided as to whether, when conducting the Fifth Amendment collateral estoppel analysis set out by this court in Ashe v. Swenson, 397 U.S. 436 (1970), a court should consider the jury's failure to reach a verdict on some counts. The issue presented here is:
Whether, when a jury acquits a defendant on multiple counts but fails to reach a verdict on other counts that share a common element, and, after a complete review of the record, the court of appeals determines that the only rational basis for the acquittals is that an essential element of the hung counts was determined in the defendant's favor, collateral estoppel bars a retrial on the hung counts.",1,0

"The court below interpreted 18 U.S.C. § 16 to include DUI with serious bodily injury as a ""crime of violence""--and therefore an ""aggravated felony"" as defined under § 101(a)(43)(F) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (""INA"")--where the statute under which Petitioner was convicted required nothing more than negligence for conviction. That ruling conflicts with decisions of other United States Courts of Appeals and with the interpretation of the Board of Immigration Appeals (""BIA "" or ""Board""). The question presented is as follows:
Whether, in the absence of a mens rea of at least recklessness with respect to the active application of force against another, DUI with serious bodily injury is a ""crime of violence"" under 18 U.S.C. § 16 that constitutes an ""aggravated felony"" under § 101 of the INA ?",1,3

"Petitioner and Respondent entered into a contract that included a provision that Petitioner is entitled to recover its attorneys’ fees incurred in connection with the enforcement, protection, or litigation of its contractual and legal rights. Petitioner incurred attorneys’ fees litigating its rights during the course of Respondent’s bankruptcy case and sought to recover them from Respondent. Adhering to its prior decision in Fobian v. Western Farm Credit Bank (In re Fobian), 951 F.2d 1149 (9th Cir. 1991), the Ninth Circuit held that Petitioner could not recover its attorneys’ fees because the relevant litigation in the bankruptcy court involved issues of federal bankruptcy law. The court reasoned that, as a matter of general federal common law, a party may not recover its attorneys’ fees pursuant to a contract or state statute where the issues litigated involve matters of federal law because only federal law may authorize such a recovery.

Did the Ninth Circuit fail to conform to “clearly established” Supreme Court law, as required by 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d), when it granted habeas corpus relief by deeming an erroneous instruction on one of two alternative theories of guilt to be “structural error” requiring reversal because the jury might have relied on it?",4,3

"Prescription drug records, which contain information about patients, doctors, and medical treatment, exist because of federal and state regulation in this highly regulated field.

The Second Circuit, deferring to EPA, held that EPA has authority to retrofit existing facilities.
