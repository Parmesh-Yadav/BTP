      "Q: the texas code does not define election laws, and we have found no case construing this phrase. thus, we first look to the ordinary, contemporary, common meaning of election laws. see perrin v. united states, 444 u.s. 37, 42, 100 s.ct. 311, 314, 62 l.ed.2d 199 (1979) (noting that it is a fundamental canon of statutory construction ... that, unless otherwise defined, words will be interpreted as taking their ordinary, contemporary, common meaning). we think that the common meaning of election laws is laws that specifically govern elections, rather than generally applicable laws that may affect elections. if the texas legislature wanted 31.003 to cover the latter, we doubt that it would have inserted the adjectival modifier election directly before the noun law. by forming an open compound phrase such as election law, the texas legislature meant a combination of separate words that are so closely related as to constitute a single concept. chicago manual of style 6.33 (14th rev. ed. 1993). an election district, for instance, is not a district devised for many functions, including elections; it is a district created for the purposes of elections. 5 oxford english dictionary 116 (2d ed. 1989). moreover, an election board is not an agency that carries out all the responsibilities of a municipality, including elections; it is an agency charged with the conduct of elections. blacks law dictionary 519 (6th ed.1990).\n",
      "A: Yes\n",
      "R: Yes, the answer is correct. The passage states that \"we first look to the ordinary, contemporary, common meaning of election laws.\" The passage then goes on to provide examples of what the common meaning of election laws is. Based on these examples, we can conclude that the answer is correct.\n",

      "Q: on the other hand, however, the plain language of rule 6(e)(2) does not support that part of jeters contention that this rule somehow forbids punishment of unjustified grand jury disclosures under any other statutory rule. rule 6(e)(2) states: no obligation of secrecy may be imposed on any person except in accordance with this rule. the surrounding language clearly supports the view that this limitation refers only to action against the aforementioned class of individuals who owe a formal and on-going obligation of secrecy due to their connection with the grand jury [a] grand juror, an interpreter, a stenographer, an operator of a recording device, a typist who transcribes recorded testimony, an attorney for the government, or any person to whom disclosure is made under paragraph (3)(a)(ii) of this subdivision [i.e., other necessary governmental personnel] [emphasis added]. it is simply illogical to attempt to construe rule 6(e)(2) as mandating that all other classes of individuals can act to destroy the secrecy of grand jury proceedings without criminal sanction.\n",
      "A: Yes\n",
      "R: The answer is yes because the passage states that \"it is simply illogical to attempt to construe rule 6(e)(2) as mandating that all other classes of individuals can act to destroy the secrecy of grand jury proceedings without criminal sanction.\" This means that the passage is saying that it is not possible to interpret rule 6(e)(2) in a way that would allow all other classes of individuals to act to destroy the secrecy of grand jury proceedings without criminal sanction.\n",

      "Q: a major difficulty undercutting the majoritys position is that, unlike the indian gaming regulatory act (igra) at issue in seminole tribe, the telecommunications act does not impose an elaborate remedial scheme upon a reviewing court; in fact, the statute fails to specify any particular relief. bell atlantic-pa., 107 f.supp.2d at 664 (citations omitted). as the delaware district court explained:\n",

      "A: No\n",
      "R: The government argues that Mr. Black's interpretation of the speedy trial act would discourage governmental consent to transfers under rule 20, which would lead to more consecutive sentences, Mr. Black could still challenge the delay based on the constitution rather than the speedy trial act, and dismissal of the indictment would impede the efficient use of resources. The government's arguments are not persuasive because they do not address the merits of Mr. Black's claim that his speedy trial rights were violated.\n",

      "Prompt: the parties also dispute the effect of the filing of a motion to dismiss for violation of the speedy trial act. to settle this dispute we need look no further than the explicit language of section 3161(h)(1)(f), which excludes the period during the pend-ency of any motion. a motion to dismissregardless of the grounds upon which it is basedis a motion like any other motion, and thus falls within the express exclusion of (f). see furlow v. united states, 644 f.2d 764, 768 (9th cir.) (district court was clearly correct in ruling that period between the filing of a motion to dismiss for want of prosecution and its disposition is excludable under (f); in reaching this conclusion, the appellate court relied only on the express language of that section), cert. denied, 454 u.s. 871, 102 s.ct. 340, 70 l.ed.2d 175 (1981); united states v. hencye, 505 f.supp. 968, 972 n. 3 (n.d.fla.1981) (dictum). but cf. united states v. new buffalo amusement corp., 600 f.2d 368, 375 (2d cir.1979) (motion to dismiss does not toll 180 day period under rules 5(a)(1) and 7(a)(1) of interim western district of new york plan). moreover, neither party points us to any other provision of the statute or any statement in its legislative history suggesting a contrary interpretation. nevertheless, appellee graham urges that we adopt a rule of non-exclusion on policy grounds, arguing that excluding time for filing dismissal motions would penalize defendants for attempting to assert their rights. of course, if the 70 day period has in fact expired at the time the motion to dismiss is filed, whether or not it stops the clock does not matter. graham suggests that a defendant concerned about the rule of barker v. wingo, 407 u.s. 514, 92 s.ct. 2182, 33 l.ed.2d 101 (1972), and united states v. herman, 576 f.2d 1139 (5th cir.1978)which requires that courts consider, among other things, the timeliness of a defendants speedy trial claim in assessing its meritsmay seek to assert his speedy trial act claim before the 70 day period has run, thus effectively postponing or precluding altogether the accrual of 70 non-excludable days. yet this overlooks the fact that barker and herman involved claims to a speedy trial under the constitution, not claims under the speedy trial act. the difference is important. under the act, a defendant may if he wishes postpone asserting a speedy trial motion to dismiss until just before trial. 18 u.s.c.a. 3162(a)(2). using this procedure, defendants uncertain as to the validity of their claims under the act can avoid stopping the clock. we also question the wisdom of forcing the government to expend the time and resources of trying a defendant whose indictment may be dismissed. but the most important reason for rejecting grahams policy argument has nothing to do with our view of the strength of the policy arguments for or against a rule of non-exclusion. policy choices are for congress to make. in the case of this issue, congress has already made them. the wording of the act clearly requires exclusion.\n",
