      "The meaning of life is a deep philosophical question that has been pondered by humans for centuries. There is no universally accepted answer, as the meaning of life is subjective and personal. Different people may find meaning in different things, such as their relationships with others, their work, their hobbies, or their spiritual beliefs. Ultimately, the meaning of life is what you make it.\n",

      "* **Help others.** Volunteer your time to a cause you care about. Helping others can make you feel good about yourself and make a difference in the world.\n",
      "* **Set goals.** Set goals for yourself that are challenging but achievable. Working towards goals can give you a sense of purpose and direction.\n",
